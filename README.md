# tool4ise
Auto-create a Jupyter tool for PhysiCell [for nanoHUB]

You will need to provide the following files in the `data` subdirectory:
```
PhysiCell_settings.xml 
initial.xml 
```

<!--
In the `data` directory, you will run the `xml2jupyter.py` script on the .xml file to 
generate `user_params.py`.
